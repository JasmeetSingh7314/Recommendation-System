There are 3 power-ups and 3 power-downs, in addition to a rock that can damage you and destroy the basket, all of which change how you approach which baby to save and when.
You have one action button which allows you to put your cloak on and take it off.

While testing, you can see how the strain is distributed across your design. Areas that are under immense strain are colored bright red, while other areas are colored green. This allows you to find and fix problem areas in your design. 

The finger test lets you use your finger to push and pull on your design. You can use this with pinpoint accuracy, or you can just smash your design to smithereens. The finger test has an explosive new twist. You can now create explosions by tapping the screen for ultimate annihilation.

The newly added Bomb Shack level includes a dummy with full support for ragdoll physics. Throw him around, blow him up, and smash him against your design.

11230,13,Simulator,,,,,StarLancer,85.73604411756378,"Starlancer is a space-based science fiction flight simulator computer game, created by Erin Roberts, Chris Roberts, and Warthog PLC under the auspices of Digital Anvil.

It is the year 2160. Mankind has colonized the solar system and two political entities have emerged: the Alliance consisting of American, Australian, French, Spanish, Italian, Japanese, British and German forces, and The Coalition of Russian, Chinese and Middle-Eastern interests. The game begins with a surprise attack on Fort Kennedy, where a peace treaty turns into a bloodbath: all of the inner four planets are overrun, including Terra herself, and the Italian and French fleets are utterly lost. The Alliance fleet regroups at Triton, Neptune's moon, and attempts to regain lost territory. The player takes the role of a rookie pilot in the international 45th Volunteers squadron, under the command of Captain Robert Foster and Wing Commander Maria Enriquez, aboard the re-commissioned British carrier ANS Reliant.

As with Wing Commander: Prophecy, the pilot's flying ability is the only meter by which success and failure is measured, though Starlancer does not feature as many branching mission paths. As in Wing Commander I the pilot may be promoted throughout the course of the campaign; unlike WCI, their rank determines which fighters and missiles they may choose to employ during each mission. The game provides a ""virtual carrier"" through which to navigate, including nearby crewmembers whose reaction to you depends on your current rank and standing. However, the true gem of the game lies in its textual and video news broadcasts, which keep the player informed as to the status of the rest of the war, which seems to be progressing just over the horizon. Players frequently find themselves flying alongside squadrons and pilots they have heard about on the news just recently, providing a dose of 'celebrity exposure' and also increasing the sensation that they are just one part of a much larger war effort.

Starlancer's story is continued in Chris Roberts' Freelancer project, though the two belong to different subgenres (the first is purely focused on action, the latter also features trading and the player can freely move through the game's universe when they are not on a mission.)",,,,,,,,

It all begins in a quiet Ankh-Morpork street, where Rincewind and The Librarian inexplicably fail to die from a nearby cart-bomb explosion. The odd event is not shared by them alone however: occurrences of the newly dead re-awakening and disturbing the populace are being reported all over the city, prompting the Archchancellor of Unseen University to halt his usual activities of feasting and merrymaking, and to take charge of the situation.

15535,5,Shooter,33,Arcade,,,Galaga '88,87.47690581425832,"The gameplay in Galaga '88 is built on the same premise as that of the original Galaga game, but is in many ways more complex and more difficult. The game is divided into a series of 29 Stages distributed through eight Worlds. The starship Galaga accelerates between Stages and Worlds and even to higher dimensions (go to the section on Dimensional Travel below to find out more).

With the exception of the third and eighth, each World culminates in a Challenging Stage. There are six such stages to engage in any full game, and each begins with the on-screen announcement ""That's Galactic Dancin'!"" and has its own YM2151-generated song to which the enemy formations dance. In any given Challenging Stage, both the design of the enemies and their dancing formations shall vary according to the player's current Dimension. As in Galaga, the objective is to destroy all forty enemies before they fly away off the screen. However, refraining completely from touching any controls for the duration of a Challenging Stage awards a ""secret bonus"" ranging in value from 10000 to 25000 points, and equal to the ""special bonus"" which would have been awarded for destroying all forty enemy aliens instead.

Galaga '88 introduces a variety of new enemies and behaviors. Most of these special enemies are worth varying amounts of bonus points when destroyed. Some enemies can combine into larger enemies which take multiple hits to destroy, while others arrive in eggs, explode in a shower of fireworks, grow with multiple hits, or sport armor which makes them invincible while in formation. Certain enemies drop small formations of tiny creatures that wiggle their way down the screen, and still others can act as escorts to incoming groups of enemies and then quickly dive at the player before leaving the game. Most stages also include various obstacles which appear once the enemy formation has been assembled. These can be destroyed with either one or several shots, and the first one on each stage will leave a ""Warp Capsule"".

At the start of the game, the player can select how many Galaga starships to start with (one or two), affecting their number of remaining lives. The game ends after the final boss is defeated (or when the player's last ship is destroyed or captured) - in the latter case, the player can continue the game for an additional credit. The Game Over screen shows the player's hit-miss ratio and a visual representation of their progress. If the player reaches Stage 27, the game also shows a picture of the final boss (damaged if defeated, but silhouetted if not). If the arcade operator has set the ""continue"" option to ""on"", the player also cannot continue if he is defeated on Stages 27-29.",,,,,,,,

It is the first game in the Baldur's Gate series and takes place in the Forgotten Realms, a high fantasy campaign setting, using a modified version of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D) 2nd edition rules. It was the first game to use the Infinity Engine for its graphics, with Interplay using the engine for other Forgotten Realms-licensed games, including the Icewind Dale series, as well as other licensed D&D campaign worlds such as Planescape: Torment. The game's story focuses on players controlling a protagonist of their own creation who finds themselves travelling across the Sword Coast alongside a party of companions, to unravel the mystery surrounding a sudden iron crisis affecting the region and attempting to discover the culprits behind it, all while uncovering dark secrets about their origins and dealing with attempts on their life.",,,,,,,,
11328,5,Shooter,8,Platform,9,Puzzle,Shadow Complex,85.54836425996591,"Shadow Complex is presented in 2.5D format; the game world is fully three-dimensional, but the player can only move in two dimensions, simulating the environment of a classic side-scrolling video game. Enemies can, however, move in any direction, and auto-aim is utilized to allow the player to fire at nearby enemies or objects both inside and outside of the 2D plane. The player can use the right control stick to aim with a laser sight. Gameplay in Shadow Complex was inspired by Super Metroid and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. The gameplay takes many cues from Metroid: the player can move freely throughout the expansive game world, defeating enemies with a variety of weapons, and as they overcome challenges, they gain new abilities and weapons which allow them to reach new areas.
The game rewards the player with experience points as they complete objectives and defeat enemies. The player can gain experience levels, each level boosting basic attributes of the character. These experience levels grant the player skills such as improved gunfire precision or damage resistance. Special rewards such as revealing the full map and unlimited special ammo are granted at specific levels. When the player starts a new game, they will lose all the weapons and items that they have acquired, but will keep the character's experience level and any benefits they have already received from that experience.
In addition to the main campaign, a number of challenge levels, called ""Proving Grounds"", are available, generally requiring the player to make it to the exit of a room using a limited set of items and health. Players are ranked based on time of completion and any scoring objectives when they complete the level. Scores and other statistics from the main campaign and the training group are tracked via online leaderboards.
A remastered version and port was announced during the 215 Game Awards, to be released for PS4, Xbox One, PC.",31,Adventure,,,,,,

■ Movement of the ball------------------ 
Various kinds of throws are materialized into “real-life like” feelings. Different pitches pull out different various kinds of movements. Thus, the batter may miss the timing and would be hard to hit.

1896,2,Point-and-click,9,Puzzle,12,Role-playing (RPG),Quest for Glory: Shadows of Darkness,85.0391407353141,"Shadows of Darkness is the fourth Quest for Glory game. It is a journey into the land of Mordavia - a setting influenced by Eastern Europe, particularly its Slavic areal. The hero had just begun to enjoy his victory in Tarna, when a spell zapped him into parts unknown, without a weapon, items, or even a source of light. Shortly after finding his way out of the dark cave, the hero meets a mysterious woman named Katrina. He traverses the swamps in the dark forest and finally reaches the town. However, the town is also engulfed by a foreboding atmosphere, and the hero cannot allow himself to relax. He must find out what is going on, why the town inhabitants are so hesitant and reluctant to help him, and what horrors are lurking outside of its walls. Life has never been quite so dangerous for our hero. He'll discover his quest soon enough - that is, if he lives.

Like the previous Quest For Glory titles, the game is a combination of puzzle-solving adventure and role-playing. The player character can be a fighter, a thief, a magician, or a paladin. Importing a character from a preceding installment of the series is also possible. Once again the hero improves his skills by repeatedly using them (like throwing stones at a tree to improve the throwing ability, which might be needed to solve a puzzle).

Combat system in this installment has undergone a major change. Battles are viewed from a side-scrolling perspective and are action-oriented. The protagonist is able to move freely, jump, and execute attacks and defensive moves, similarly to fighting games. The CD version of the game adds voice-overs to conversations as well as narrator's voice to text descriptions.",31,Adventure,,,,,,

58656,8,Platform,10,Racing,33,Arcade,Chameleon Run,90,"Chameleon Run is a single player game primarily available to mobile devices. The game is a high speed auto-runner with a satisfying double-jump mechanic played in landscape mode with both hands. 
 
The game features minimal, yet colourful aesthetics, with upbeat music and nice sound effects. There are no virtual controls visible on screen, instead the player taps on either side of the display to control the avatar. 
 
The goal of the game is to pick up items while traversing the track to reach the finish line. The items picked up are used to unlock more tracks. Reaching the goal will require the avatar to jump over obstacles while at all times ensuring that the colour of the avatar matches the colour of the running surface. The latter mechanic is what makes this runner somewhat unique. Many of the tracks feature two or more paths to the goal, which increases the longevity of the game. 
 
First launch opens directly on the first track, which is used to teach how to switch colour mid-air while jumping to prevent the avatar from exploding. After the tutorial is completed, you are taken to the menu where the first track is unlocked. 
 
The game consists of a series of grouped tracks which have to be unlocked by collecting enough chameleons - found along the tracks. The number of chameleons required to progress is shown on screen while in the menu. 
 
As of writing the game is available to iOS, Android and Windows mobile phones, as well as tvOS (Apple TV).",,,,,,,,

3798,12,Role-playing (RPG),,,,,Dungeon Master,86.26978883964526,"Dungeon Master established several new standards for role playing and computer games in general. Dungeon Master was a realtime game instead of the traditional turn-based approach that was prevalent until then. Instead of using text-based commands to interact with the environment, players directly manipulated objects and the environment by clicking the mouse in the enlarged first-person view.

Abstract Dungeons and Dragons style experience points and levels were eschewed in favor of a system where the characters' skills were improved directly via using them. It also introduced some novel control methods including the spell casting system, which involved learning sequences of runes which represented the form and function of a spell's effect. For example, a fireball spell was created by mixing the fire symbol with the wing symbol. This kind of attention to detail and focus on the user interface was typical of the game and helped create an often captivating sense of craft and ingenuity. Other factors in immersiveness were the then-revolutionary use of sound effects to indicate when a creature was nearby, and (primitive) dynamic lighting.",,,,,,,,

Free expansion packs were released, some of which were bundled with a 2000 re-release: Unreal Tournament: Game of the Year Edition.

The game is based on the same technology that powered Unreal, but the design of Unreal Tournament shifted the series' focus to competitive multiplayer action. Development took 18 months, and the game was initially intended to be an expansion for Unreal. Unreal Tournament received critical acclaim, with reviewers praising the graphics, artificial intelligence and gameplay, although the console ports were noted for having limitations. The game won several awards, and remakes have been attempted by fans.

When you find the berserk pack and get super strength, you can perform cinematic executions and RIP AND TEAR your foes with your bare hands. Some enemies will scream in anguish and try to crawl away when near death, and they can be used as human shields, and much, much more.

Everything in Brutal Doom is extremely intense. Everything sounds louder, looks bigger, moves faster, and hits harder. You can even fell the impact of explosions. Enemies are harder and smarter, and weapons and explosions are much louder. Your weapons have been upgraded to a deadly arsenal, completely throwing the vanilla Doom's ""progressive weapon system"" through the window. Every weapon is powerful and have it's pros and cons, a a weapon will never be outclassed when you find a new weapon, but only find a different use for different situations, making Brutal Doom more balanced and more strategic than Vanilla gameplay.

IT'S REALLY GOOD by Turbo444
Five months of daily play, and it’s still fun. Many puzzle games have levels that get progressively more difficult, until I get to the point where it’s just not fun anymore, and I stop playing. Wooden Block Puzzle has just one level. It is always the same... never gets harder to play. But it never gets boring, and has actually become more fun the longer I play, because the possibilities are endless, and the challenge is built-in. You can try to beat your own high score... or not. Very well-crafted by some genius developer. Thanks, Dev.

LOTS OF FUN by Kym6erlee
""I just recently downloaded this game and after the first game, I was absolutely in love. It's challenging entertaining, and requires a degree of concentration but without too much stress. Very similar to Tetris but the tiles do not rotate so you need to place them as they appear and the set of three tiles will not be replaced until the three present are situated on the board. That's how you will either win or lose the game. I recommended it.""

WOODEN BLOCKS by Merina
""Ok, I hate the friend who introduced this fun and addicting game to me yesterday. I sat and played for 90 minutes straight, telling myself ""only one more game... ""I LOVE this game. Just when I think I've outsmarted the game it comes back and shows me who's boss. It's an easy, clever game, much the old Tetris, just not as fast. If you like fitting puzzle pieces together then this is your game.""

Tolkien’s Middle-earth that has been continuously running, enhanced, and remastered since fall of 1991. In MUME, players are encouraged to role-play as they live in this meticulously crafted world exploring the conflict leading into the War of the Ring during the late Third Age. The action takes place nearly 100 years prior to The Hobbit but long after the loss of the One Ring by Sauron. The key to Erebor has just been found by Gandalf in Dol Guldur and all the epic tales narrated in The Lord of the Rings may take place.

MUME covers 28,000+ original rooms from the mighty Dwarven Halls beyond the Gulf of the Lhûn in the West to the Mountains of Mirkwood in the East, and from the ruins of Fornost Erain in the North to the fortress of Isengard in the South.

Players can choose among several different races, each with some unique characteristics. The races are separated into three striving factions. Dwarves, Elves, Half-Elves, Hobbits and Men — among them are the shapeshifting Beornings — are eternally at war with the Orcs, Trolls and Black Númenóreans.

Von den Spielemagazinen wurde es mit guten Wertungen bedacht (z. B. PC Player 87 %, Gamestar 88 %, PC Games 86 %).
Jedoch war es zu Beginn geradezu gefüllt mit Bugs, was von der Spielergemeinde kritisiert wurde. Dennoch wurde es von den Anstoss-Fans mit Begeisterung aufgenommen, da es die wichtigsten Elemente von Anstoss 2 Gold enthielt und diese noch weiter vertiefen konnte.
Als besonders gelungen gilt die 3D-Spieldarstellung. Der Spieler konnte sich ein komplettes Spiel seines Teams reduziert auf neun Minuten ansehen. Auch der Szenenmodus galt als revolutionär, da die Szenen nicht, wie in den Vorgängerteilen, vorberechnet wurden. Kommentiert wurden die Spielszenen durch den bekannten Fußballkommentator Günther Koch.
Auch neu war die Umsetzung des Vereinsgeländes. Von Apfelbäumen über Konditionsparcours und Doping-Labor bis hin zu Wolkenkratzern konnte der Spieler sein Vereinsgelände mit Gebäuden, Gegenständen und Lebewesen mit und ohne Nutzen erweitern.
Mit der Veröffentlichung des finalen Patches auf Version 1.40 wurde es nahezu bugfrei und konnte die Anstoss-Spieler überzeugen. Insgesamt wurden bis heute über eine Million Exemplare von Anstoss 3 verkauft und machen es damit zu einem der erfolgreichsten PC-Spiele Deutschlands. Trotz seines Alters wird Anstoss 3 durch die große Spieltiefe zusammen mit einem gelungenen Text- und 3D-Modus als bester Teil der Anstoss-Reihe angesehen.

Between some stages one of three intermission animations plays. Four enemies (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde) roam the maze, trying to catch Pac-Man. If an enemy touches Pac-Man, a life is lost and the Pac-Man itself withers and dies. When all lives have been lost, the game ends. Pac-Man is awarded a single bonus life at 10,000 points by default.

Near the corners of the maze are four larger, flashing dots known as power pellets that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the enemies. The enemies turn deep blue, reverse direction and usually move more slowly. When an enemy is eaten, its eyes remain and return to the center box where it is regenerated in its normal color. Blue enemies flash white to signal that they are about to become dangerous again and the length of time for which the enemies remain vulnerable varies from one stage to the next, generally becoming shorter as the game progresses. In later stages, the enemies go straight to flashing, bypassing blue, which means that they can only be eaten for a short amount of time, although they still reverse direction when a power pellet is eaten; in even later stages, the ghosts do not become edible (i.e., they do not change color and still make Pacman lose a life on contact), but they still reverse direction.",,,,,,,,

Gamers can select from nearly every NCAA coach currently in the industry or create their own. Each coach has a number of different attributes, and these attributes will determine many different aspects of the game. Charisma, for example, affects recruitment and player confidence, while discipline will help players focus on the game. Players may also bring issues to the coach to solve, which also affects the team's playing ability as well. Gamers will also have access to the coach's clipboard during the game. The clipboard will pop up automatically when gamers need to make adjustments instead of requiring gamers to access a series of menus. Another new feature are the four points of emphasis: ball control, defense, rebounding, and shot selection. Selecting one will boast the team's particular effectiveness in that area proportionate to the coach's attributes. Recruiting, likewise, has been upgraded and tweaked. Gamers can track 15 potential recruits during the season, watching their interest levels and stats and have the option of controlling the recruiting themselves or allowing the assistant coaches to deal many of the decisions.

Keirin, the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, Angkor Wat, Ayers Rock, the Taj Mahal, Leningrad, Paris, London, Barcelona, Athens, Egypt, Kenya, New York, Maya ruins, Antarctica, and finally Easter Island.

Each location has a unique background that shows the area's most famous landmarks. The stages contain a different layout of blocks, some that disappear after being shot, others that do not, and still others that are hidden and can reveal bonuses.

The stages start with differing numbers and sizes of balloons. The largest balloon divides for the first three times it is popped; after the fourth and smallest balloon is popped it vanishes. Each player starts with a single harpoon. When a balloon is popped, special weapons may drop down.

At a certain point in the stage, a food item will drop down that is worth several thousand bonus points.

If a player touches a balloon of any size, the player dies and both players must start the stage again.

When both players touch a balloon at the same time, only Player 1 will lose a life but this is somewhat offset because when both players reach a bonus or weapon simultaneously only Player 1 will get it.

Players start with 3-5 lives depending on the dip switch setting. Extra lives are also given when certain point totals have been accumulated. The stage ends when all of the balloons are successfully cleared. The game ends after all stages have been completed and our heroic duo ride their jeep into the sunset on an Easter Island beach.

The player is initially given only a limited number of cubes in a ""magazine"" to complete the objective in each stage, but more cubes are added in the magazine to the player the more cubes they take away from the Cubello. However, unlike many other games, such as Puzzle Bobble, where the goal is to eliminate objects of certain colors or shapes, Cubello continues to provide the player with cubes colors that are either still in the magazine or on the stage, so the player has to calculate to have the color disappear from the magazine and the stage at the same time to win. There is also a ""Bonus Mode"" on the slot machine device that gives the player unlimited cubes to shoot of one color, or ""Super Bonus Mode"" which gives cubes of different colors depending on where they are launched at.

The game features a humorous plot revolving around the central character, an octopus who is undercover as an average human with a family.

Its sequel Dadliest Catch was released on January 30, 2014, and was one of the first titles to be given the Steam Greenlight.

This newest game is challenging, exciting, and even infuriating, at times. Like all great puzzles, Six! will keep you entertained for just a moment, or will keep you engaged for hours of fun.

The game concept is simple: there is a tower of blocks of various shapes, upon which sits another hexagonal block. The aim of the game is to move the hexagon down the screen to earn points. To do this, you tap the different blocks, which will make them disappear. The hexagon can then fall into the empty space left behind.

Sounds simple enough, right? Wrong. As the blocks are destroyed, the hexagon will start to wobble and roll, and the tower will begin to tilt. It is your job to keep the tower balanced, and the hexagon from gaining momentum and rolling of. To do so, remove blocks strategically, and ensure that their removal won’t throw everything off balance. If the hexagon tips into the abyss, it’s game over, and you’ll have to start over again.

Challenging, exciting, and surprisingly simple to play, Six! will have you hooked immediately. Like Gram’s other hits, the gameplay is simple and fun, but earning a spot on the leaderboard and competing with friends provides both a challenge, and a reward.

The narrative revolves around Kratos, the protagonist from earlier instalments, who was once a loyal servant of the God of War, Ares. Tricked by Ares into unknowingly murdering his own family, Kratos breaks the blood oath binding him to Ares and abandons his former master. Subsequently, Kratos finds himself imprisoned and must navigate a path to freedom, severing the bond between him and Ares.

The game retains the familiar hack-and-slash combat system of its predecessors, featuring Kratos wielding the Blades of Chaos. However, a new addition, the World Weapon system, allows Kratos to wield various weapons. Additionally, Kratos can now acquire up to four magical disciplines—Fires of Ares, Ice of Poseidon, Lightning of Zeus, and Soul of Hades—each bestowing unique abilities and imbuing his weapon with magic. For instance, the Ice of Poseidon enables underwater breathing. Rage, a recurring feature, undergoes modifications; it accumulates through attacks, and when the bar is full, it automatically unleashes until the player ceases attacking or sustains damage. Three new relics provide Kratos with the ability to manipulate time, create a ""shadow"" self, and dispel illusions crafted by his guardians.

Notably, God of War: Ascension introduces online multiplayer to the series. Players, before engaging in multiplayer battles, align with one of four gods—Ares, Hades, Zeus, or Poseidon—each offering a distinct set of abilities. As players accumulate experience and level up their warriors, they unlock magical abilities, armour, weapons, relics, and other treasures. The game features four distinct multiplayer modes: Team Favor of the Gods, Match of Champions, Trial of the Gods, and Capture the Flag",,,,,,,,

Jon Lockhart walked through the prison gates a free man, after spending years imprisoned as the supposed murderer of an old friend. He returned once more to the city where it all started intent on figuring out who it was that framed him for the murder and make them pay in blood for the crime. It'd take some work with the key witness dead, but that just meant he'd have to flush out every rat from hiding. Old friends and new enemies.

Caution should be taken, though, as some enemies are able to do the same thing to the players. The player begins the game with a certain number of extra lives and a life gauge which depletes as the player takes hits. If the life gauge runs out or the time limit reaches zero, the player will lose a life.

There is a small variety of enemy characters that the player will face through the course of the game. Certain enemies carry melee weapons, which can be knocked out of their hands and picked up to use against them. Available weapons include baseball bats, whips, throwing knives, and dynamite; in addition, rocks, oil drums, and boxes can be found in certain places.

All of Skateboarding In The Palm Of Your Hand

Designed by skaters for skaters, we teamed up with 20 of the most prominent brands in skating to create the game every skater has been waiting for:

Powerful And Intuitive Control

Use the touch screen to directly control your shoes and board. Controls have been carefully designed to highlight the things that are most fun and important in actual skating, with a strong focus on flow of tricks and runs.

Every Trick Is Possible

This is the first touch-based skating game to include the full range of street tricks. Jump from Ollie, Switch, Fakie and Nollie and perform all standard flip tricks; with the inclusion of body rotations you can even do tricks such as Front-Side Flips and Big Flips. With recent updates now including Late Flips, Reverts, Ghetto Birds, Impossibles, Dolphin Flips, Dragon Flips and Gazelles. Chain everything together with manuals, nose manuals and every kind of grind and slide.

Share And Discover Runs

Skater allows you to save your favourite trick runs and share them with the world. In turn, you get to discover and copy runs that other players have created – giving you access to an endless feed of new ideas to explore.

The Latest Gear – Already Included

Pick from the latest shoes and decks to skate with; DC Shoes, Revive, DGK, etnies, Emerica, éS, Foundation, Lakai, Toy Machine, Zero, Baker, Deathwish, Shake Junt, Amgrip, Spitfire, Thunder, Venture, Pig Wheels, Force and Bro Style – they are all already included in the game.

Real, Legendary Spots

The spots featured are El Toro, Carlsbad Gap, Hollywood High, Stoner Plaza, Camp Woodward, Love Park and The Berrics – with even more to come in future updates! Starting with architectural plans, height maps and photos we took on-site, every detail of these legendary spots has been faithfully recreated – down to the graffiti, street signs and even stickers on obstacles.

Skater Celebrates Style and Individuality

Knowing that different people see different things in a spot and skate it in their own unique way, Skater blurs the line between single and multiplayer experiences to enable social interaction unlike any other previous skating game. It’s like taking part in a the world’s biggest online skate session…

Go skate at some of the most famous spots in history with content from thousands of players from around the world – any time you want!",,,,,,,,

In 1984 the ASCII Corporation published a version produced by Khaled Bentebal. It was the basis of numerous clones in the later years. It is set in a warehouse. On each level, the player must push crates (from square to square) to get them onto designated spots; once each crate is on a marked spot, the level is complete. Crates can only be pushed one at a time (so two crates next to each other cannot be pushed together), and cannot be pulled--so it's possible to get a crate stuck in a corner, where it cannot be retrieved!

There are seven stages, each with its own boss and a variety of generic enemies that try to stop the players' progress. The fights rely strongly on blocking ability, which is triggered by pressing the attack button, then pressing the joystick away as the opponent strikes. If successful, the player gains a few seconds of invincibility with which to counter-attack. However, if no one strikes the player's character while holding the block, they will tire and drop their guard, making them vulnerable to attack. Blocking is vital in certain cases, since some bosses will be vulnerable only after their attack has been blocked by the player.

As in most beat 'em ups, a desperation attack is performed by pressing both the attack and jump buttons simultaneously. This knocks out most enemies on the screen, but the player loses a little bit of health every time he uses it.",31,Adventure,33,Arcade,,,,

The game concept is simple: there is a tower of blocks of various shapes, upon which sits another hexagonal block. The aim of the game is to move the hexagon down the screen to earn points. To do this, you tap the different blocks, which will make them disappear. The hexagon can then fall into the empty space left behind.

Sounds simple enough, right? Wrong. As the blocks are destroyed, the hexagon will start to wobble and roll, and the tower will begin to tilt. It is your job to keep the tower balanced, and the hexagon from gaining momentum and rolling of. To do so, remove blocks strategically, and ensure that their removal won’t throw everything off balance. If the hexagon tips into the abyss, it’s game over, and you’ll have to start over again.

Challenging, exciting, and surprisingly simple to play, Six! will have you hooked immediately. Like Gram’s other hits, the gameplay is simple and fun, but earning a spot on the leaderboard and competing with friends provides both a challenge, and a reward.

109,15,Strategy,31,Adventure,,,L.A. Noire,82.3735534387601,"L.A. Noire is a neo-noir detective action-adventure video game developed by Team Bondi and published by Rockstar Games. It was initially released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms on 17 May 2011; a Microsoft Windows port was later released on 8 November 2011.

L.A. Noire is set in Los Angeles in 1947 and challenges the player, controlling a Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officer, to solve a range of cases across five divisions. Players must investigate crime scenes for clues, follow up leads, and interrogate suspects, and the player's success at these activities will impact how much of each case's story is revealed.

The game draws heavily from both the plot and aesthetic elements of film noir—stylistic films made popular in the 1940s and 1950s that share similar visual styles and themes, including crime and moral ambiguity—along with drawing inspiration from real-life crimes for its in-game cases, based upon what was reported by the Los Angeles media in 1947.

The game uses a distinctive colour palette, but in homage to film noir it includes the option to play the game in black and white. Various plot elements reference the major themes of detective and mobster stories such as The Naked City, Chinatown, The Untouchables, The Black Dahlia, and L.A. Confidential.",,,,,,,,

It was released on November 21, 2003 and is a reboot of the landmark video game series Prince of Persia, created by Jordan Mechner in 1989.

The Sands of Time, developed internally at Ubisoft Montreal, successfully captures the mechanics of the original platformer and extends it to the 3D generation. An earlier attempt by The Learning Company to transfer the game to 3D (Prince of Persia 3D) was released in 1999, but despite its initial good reception failed to sell enough and the company responsible for the original trilogy was already closing doors. The game was praised for its visual design, finely tuned game mechanics and intriguing storyline, winning the game several awards.

The game was developed for the PC, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox, and later a 2D-version for the Game Boy Advance and mobile phones. The success of The Sands of Time led to three followups, Prince of Persia: Warrior Within (2004), Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones (2005), and Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands (2010). A remastered, high-definition, version of The Sands of Time was released on the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 on November 16, 2010.",,,,,,,,

14986,12,Role-playing (RPG),,,,,Legend of Mana,80.55431147755331,"While incorporating action role-playing game elements from the three games which preceded it, Legend of Mana has its own distinct style of gameplay. Most notably, it gives the player the ability to shape the game's world of Fa'Diel according to his or her desires, a system which was incorporated through the use of ""artifacts,"" which are gained as the player progresses through the game. The player uses the artifacts to create different towns, dungeons, etc., called ""Lands"", to venture to and explore. This creates a non-linear gameplay, since the game is driven by a series of what would be considered side-quests in other games. Legend of Mana features three different plots which can occur simultaneously, and which do not necessarily need to be completed for the player to finish the game.

Legend of Mana was a financial success in Japan. While the game garnered considerable praise for its graphics and presentation, many critics and fans were turned off by the game's lack of a main storyline.",,,,,,,,

15303,15,Strategy,32,Indie,,,Conquest of Elysium 3,80,"Conquest of Elysium 3 (CoE3) is a streamlined turn based fantasy strategy game with a touch of rogue-like and the complex undertones of Illwinter's Dominions series. While CoE3 appears to be a simple game with limited options at first glance, delving further into the game reveals a game of complex decision making and risky endeavors.

The main focus in CoE3 is that each race plays differently. We're not talking about a unique building and unique unit, we're talking about completely differently, with different mechanics and different goals. Perhaps you're playing a druid, focused on amassing a vast forest and jungle empire from which to harvest ingredients to summon creatures of the woods with no practical need to conquer mines. Perhaps you're a dwarf, who's only concern are mines and produce units at a set rate every turn, focused almost entirely on upgrading those units to survive as long as possible since they are so difficult to replace. With 18 different factions that alone is enough to keep your play dynamic as you vie for control of the map to conquer Elysium. That isn't where it ends, however, there are 6 scenarios in which your game takes place that will help randomize the map. These scenarios range from a the early days of an agrarian world to a giant gleaming capital, which you can conquer, that spawns patrols of human guards, to a fallen empire filled with the living dead and scarred by battlefields and tombs. There's also random events to contend with, from merchants to pillage to the very gates of the underworld opening portals to your realm, your hands will be full before you even make contact with the enemy.

In each game the objective is to defeat your enemies by relying on the strengths of your chosen race. Combat in CoE3 is automatic to keep things streamlined, but that doesn't make it non-strategic. Each unit has a desired ""location"" it wants to be in the battlefield. Archers want to be in the rear, heavy infantry want to be in front. As you can imagine, putting together an army that has enough strength to protect the powerful archers and spell casters in the rear is vital. It goes beyond that though, as you must determine your enemy's strengths and hopefully be able to counter their strategy. An army of a mere 10 trolls is extremely dangerous, perhaps able to bring down a dragon, but they can only kill 10 creatures at once. An army of 50 small units will make short work of your trolls. However, an army with a wizard able to cast high level spell may completely destroy all 50 small units in one shot but would be unable to harm 10 trolls. Determining the strength and composition of an enemy army is a vital skill, and since hitting in combat, damage, and even the very spells that will be cast are randomized based on the abilities of each unit, every battle invites potential disaster and a change of plans.Key Features:

18 different classes that are unique, both in resources they need and the rituals or special abilities they have

Random maps.

Cities in Caesar III try to accurately reflect the life of Roman citizens: the lowest plebians live in tents and shacks, while the richest patricians live in villas. Staple foods include wheat, fruits, vegetables, and pork, and wine is required for some festivals and houses. Citizens wander the streets in their various garbs and can tell the player their name and how they feel about the city. The city is viewed in a two dimensional isometric view with a fixed magnification level, and can be rotated ninety degrees.
Access to services such as market goods, entertainment, hygiene, education, and taxation are represented by ""walkers,"" which are people sent out from their buildings to patrol the streets. Any house that is passed by a walker is considered to have access to the services of the walker's building. All movements of goods and coverage of walkers are accurately reflected by citizens walking the streets: a player can watch a farm's crop progress, and when it's ready a worker will push a full cart from the farm to a nearby warehouse or granary; then return with an empty cart.
Background music is played which varies according to the situation (gentle themes to begin with, war drums during times of conflict and triumphal music when the player nears the objective). Musical themes are supplemented by crowd noises, the sounds of manufacturing and the clash of weapons at appropriate times.
There are two ways to play the game: Mission Mode, which is tantamount to typical ""campaign"" modes of other strategy games, and City Construction Mode, in which the player plays one scenario from scratch.",,,,,,,,

11794,24,Tactical,,,,,Sudden Strike,80.81971125762209,"Sudden Strike is a real-time tactics (RTT) computer game set in World War II and the first game in the Sudden Strike series. The game was developed by Fireglow based in Russia and published by CDV software of Germany. The player selects a faction (e.g. Soviets, Germans, or Allied forces) and gains control of many varied units such as infantry, tanks and artillery. The games focus primarily on tactics, eschewing traditional real-time strategy resource gathering and base development.

GAMEPLAY:
The main story features three campaigns (Soviets, Germans, and Allied forces). The battles are presented in an isometric perspective with line-of-sight occlusions and practical cover. Sudden Strike helped pioneer the real-time tactics genre, building upon concepts established by Counter Action for DOS, which was published by Mindscape in 1996.

Sudden Strike utilizes accurate in-game physics with houses and buildings obstructing units' view, line-of-sight and firing range whereas clumps of trees can provide cover to reduce the damage of tank ordnance. The game allows units to garrison a building for a stronger firing position, especially valuable for anti-tank infantry. Units can also hold their fire, providing much-needed reconnaissance. Damage evaluation is also realistic; tanks or other vehicles that take too much damage are rendered immobile unless repairs are made.

SUDDEN STRIKE FOREVER:
Sudden Strike Forever was an official add-on to Sudden Strike which introduces many more historically correct units and equipment, such as the upgraded Soviet T-34 tank (1944 version). New terrains are also provided: a desert terrain for the British missions in Tobruk and Tripoli and snow terrains for Soviet missions. The expansion also polished the game engine, balanced the damage of certain units, and added a map and scenario editor.

The add-on includes 4 inter-linked scenarios for each of the campaigns for the Germans, the American, the British and the Soviets. Other units which are added into the add-on includes, but not limited to the Universal Carrier for the British; the BR-5 artillery, 160mm grenade launcher for the Soviet forces and more. The supply system has also been tweaked with artillery crews automatically resupplying themselves with ammo crates nearby instead of relying on supply trucks to do the job. The supply trucks would still be needed to repair damages inflicted on these artillery units, however.

The German campaign puts the player into the winter setting of Russian hinterlands with limited troops and reinforcements available, thus relying on use of captured Soviet artillery as well as equipment. The British campaign deals with the defense of an unnamed seaport from German attacks, whereas the American campaign probably takes place in France during the autumn season as the foliage on the vegetation suggest. The Soviet campaign involves a large armored division counter-attack on Russian soil and the storming of the Wehrmacht-controlled airfields. As with the earlier Sudden Strike original campaigns, the briefings do not explain the historical setting of the campaign, thus only issuing standardized orders to the player to e.g. dispel enemy attacks or to simply take over a designated airfield in the east and so on. The add-on also includes 5 new single player individual scenarios.

RECEPTION:
As indicated by the cover art the game was regarded as ""The Best Real-time Strategy Game of the Year"" and generally received positive reviews.Sudden Strike holds a 69 Metascore based on 16 critics and an 8.2 user score based on 15 ratings on Metacritic. Sudden Strike Forever holds a 70 Metascore from 5 critics and an 8.8 User Score based on 46 ratings.",,,,,,,,

2195,4,Fighting,14,Sport,,,Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!,82.623383468897,"Punch-Out!!, originally released in North America as Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!, is a boxing sports fighting video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) developed and published by Nintendo in 1987. Part of the Punch-Out!! series, it is a port of both the Punch-Out!! and Super Punch-Out!! arcade games (particularly the latter) with some variations.
Punch-Out!! features a boxer known as Little Mac working his way up the professional boxing circuits, facing a series of colorful, fictional boxers, leading to a final fight with real-life boxer, the then-World Heavyweight Champion, which is Mike Tyson in the original version and Mr. Dream in the later version.
Little Mac has a limited repertoire compared to most of his opponents. His punches are limited to left and right jabs, left and right body blows, and a powerful uppercut. The uppercut can only be used once the player earns a star, which is typically accomplished by counter-punching the opponent directly before or after certain attacks are launched. The player can acquire up to three stars. To perform the uppercut, the player needs to press the start button once a star is earned. To defend, Mac can dodge left or right, duck, and block punches by putting up his guard.
Little Mac also has a heart meter, which decreases by three upon being struck by an opponent and one upon blocking an attack or an opponent blocking/dodging the player's attack. When the heart meter decreases to zero, Little Mac temporarily turns pink and appears exhausted, leaving the player unable to attack but still able to dodge or block. At this point, Mac can regain some hearts (and his normal color palette) only by avoiding the opponent's punches. He immediately loses all of his hearts upon being knocked down, but can regain some by getting up.
A bout can end by knockout (KO), if a fighter is unable to get up within ten seconds after being knocked down; by technical knockout (TKO), if a fighter is knocked down three times in one round; or by decision, if the bout lasts three full rounds without a clear winner. In order to win by decision, the player must accumulate higher than a certain point total by punching the opponent and/or knocking him down (different boxers require different point totals to win by decision). However, some bouts cannot be won in this manner and will automatically result in a loss for the player if the opponent is not knocked out. Mac can only get up three times during any one bout; if he is knocked down a fourth time, he will be unable to rise and thus lose by knockout.
When Mac loses his first bout to a ranked opponent, he will have a chance to fight a rematch. However, if he loses a Title Bout, he will fall in the rankings - one place for the Minor or Major Circuits, two places for the World Circuit. Losing a rematch causes him to fall one place (unless he is already at the bottom of his circuit), forcing him to fight his way back up. A third loss (not necessarily a consecutive one) ends the game. The exception is the final fight against Mike Tyson/Mr. Dream; a loss to them automatically results in a game over.",,,,,,,,
